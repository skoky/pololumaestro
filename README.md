Pololu Maestro controller library
=============

Servo control library for [Pololu Maestro 12, 16 and 24 boards](http://www.pololu.com/product/1352). Works on Linux, Mac and Windows. 
Maestro 6 is probably not compatible, use this library [https://github.com/reines/maestro](https://github.com/reines/maestro)

The library enables servo position, acceleration and speed to be set. Maestro board must be switched to serial mode 
"USB Dual Port" to work. The controll port has to be used to work properly.
